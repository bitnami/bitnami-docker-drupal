# What is Drupal?

> Drupal is one of the most versatile open source content management systems on the market. Drupal is built for high performance and is scalable to many servers, has easy integration via REST, JSON, SOAP and other formats, and features a whopping 15,000 plugins to extend and customize the application for just about any type of website.

# Prerequisites

To run this application you need Docker Engine 1.10.0. Docker Compose is recommended with a version 1.6.0 or later.

# How to use this image

## Run Drupal with a Database Container

Running Drupal with a database server is the recommended way. You can either use docker-compose or run the containers manually.

### Run the application using Docker Compose

This is the recommended way to run Drupal. You can use the following docker compose template:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    volumes:
      - 'mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
  drupal:
    image: 'bitnami/drupal:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - 'drupal_data:/bitnami/drupal'
      - 'apache_data:/bitnami/apache'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

volumes:
  mariadb_data:
    driver: local
  drupal_data:
    driver: local
  apache_data:
    driver: local
```

### Run the application manually

If you want to run the application manually instead of using docker-compose, these are the basic steps you need to run:

1. Create a new network for the application and the database:

  ```
  $ docker network create drupal_network
  ```

2. Start a MariaDB database in the network generated:

  ```
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb --net=drupal_network bitnami/mariadb
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to Drupal to resolve the host

3. Run the Drupal container:

  ```
  $ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name drupal --net=drupal_network bitnami/drupal
  ```

Then you can access your application at http://your-ip/

## Persisting your application

If you remove every container and volume all your data will be lost, and the next time you run the image the application will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed. If you are using docker-compose your data will be persistent as long as you don't remove `mariadb_data` and `application_data` data volumes. If you have run the containers manually or you want to mount the folders with persistent data in your host follow the next steps:

> **Note!** If you have already started using your application, follow the steps on [backing](#backing-up-your-application) up to pull the data from your running container down to your host.

### Mount persistent folders in the host using docker-compose

This requires a sightly modification from the template previously shown:
```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:latest'
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/your/local/mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb'
  drupal:
    image: 'bitnami/drupal:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/your/local/drupal_data:/bitnami/drupal'
      - '/path/to/your/local/apache_data:/bitnami/apache'
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
```

### Mount persistent folders manually

In this case you need to specify the directories to mount on the run command. The process is the same than the one previously shown:

1. If you haven't done this before, create a new network for the application and the database:

  ```
  $ docker network create drupal_network
  ```

2. Start a MariaDB database in the previous network:

  ```
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb -v /your/local/path/bitnami/mariadb_data:/bitnami/mariadb  --network=drupal_network bitnami/mariadb
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to Drupal to resolve the host

3. Run the Drupal container:

  ```
  $ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name drupal -v /your/local/path/bitnami/drupal:/bitnami/drupal --network=drupal_network bitnami/drupal
  ```

# Upgrade this application

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and Drupal, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the Drupal container. For the MariaDB upgrade see https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/blob/master/README.md#upgrade-this-image

1. Get the updated images:

  ```
  $ docker pull bitnami/drupal:latest
  ```

2. Stop your container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop drupal`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker stop drupal`

3. (For non-compose execution only) Create a [backup](#backing-up-your-application) if you have not mounted the drupal folder in the host.

4. Remove the currently running container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose rm drupal`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker rm drupal`

5. Run the new image

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose start drupal`
 * For manual execution ([mount](#mount-persistent-folders-manually) the directories if needed): `docker run --name drupal bitnami/drupal:latest`

# Configuration
## Environment variables
 When you start the drupal image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the docker run command line. If you want to add a new environment variable:

 * For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section:
```yaml
drupal:
  image: bitnami/drupal:latest
  ports:
    - 80:80
  environment:
    - DRUPAL_PASSWORD=my_password
  volumes_from:
    - application_data
```

 * For manual execution add a `-e` option with each variable and value:

```
 $ docker run -d -e DRUPAL_PASSWORD=my_password -p 80:80 --name drupal -v /your/local/path/bitnami/drupal:/bitnami/drupal --network=drupal_network bitnami/drupal
```

Available variables:

 - `DRUPAL_USERNAME`: Drupal application username. Default: **user**
 - `DRUPAL_PASSWORD`: Drupal application password. Default: **bitnami**
 - `DRUPAL_EMAIL`: Drupal application email. Default: **user@example.com**
 - `MARIADB_USER`: Root user for the MariaDB database. Default: **root**
 - `MARIADB_PASSWORD`: Root password for the MariaDB.
 - `MARIADB_HOST`: Hostname for MariaDB server. Default: **mariadb**
 - `MARIADB_PORT`: Port used by MariaDB server. Default: **3306**

# Backing up your application

To backup your application data follow these steps:

1. Stop the running container:

  * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop drupal`
  * For manual execution: `$ docker stop drupal`

2. Copy the Drupal data folder in the host:

  ```
  $ docker cp /your/local/path/bitnami:/bitnami/drupal
  ```

# Restoring a backup

To restore your application using backed up data simply mount the folder with Drupal data in the container. See [persisting your application](#persisting-your-application) section for more info.
